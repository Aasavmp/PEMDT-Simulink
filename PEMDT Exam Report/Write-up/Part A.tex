    \subsection{Fundamental Building Blocks and Design}
        The fundamental building block in power electronic converters is the power semiconductor device. These devices are usually diodes or transistors, enabling precise control over electrical current and voltage flow. Given that they are typically used for switching operations, they allow for converting electrical power from one form to another, such as from AC to DC or, in our case, from one DC voltage level to another. 

        As the system is required to decrease the DC voltage level, two main voltage regulators can be used: a linear regulator or a switched-mode power supply (SMPS). The appropriate topology for compact DC-to-DC converters with high efficiencies, commonly known as buck converters, typically uses field effect transistors like MOSFETs and IGBTs in switch mode. However, these converters require passive components to smooth and filter the outputs of the switch. Designing this type of power electronic converter requires a systematic approach which incorporates the following steps:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For a given switching frequency, a pulse width modulated (PWM) waveform is generated using a duty cycle (\(\delta\)) derived from the stated input and output voltage. 
            
            \item The appropriate power semiconductor device has to be selected for switching. This primarily depends on the voltage/current rating, switching speed and losses of the chosen transistor and how well it adheres to the given system. This switch is fed an input from the low-voltage DC bus and the PWM to create a modulated voltage waveform.

            \item A diode is set up anti-parallel to the input voltage. The appropriate diode must be selected to allow free-wheeling current flow in the correct direction when the switch is off and blocks the reverse voltage when the switch is on.

            \item The capacitor and inductor are passive components set up in parallel and series to the input voltage, respectively. Their capacitance and inductance values have to be derived to filter, smooth and shape voltage and current fluctuations, respectively.

            \item The correct heat sink has to be selected for thermal management that implements appropriate heat dissipation and cooling mechanisms to keep the switching device within its safe operating temperature range. 

            \item The final step requires the design to be optimised. Analysis of the system with different switching frequencies generally shows that a higher switching frequency offers advantages such as the reduced size of inductors and capacitors, leading to compact designs and higher power density. However, it has disadvantages, including increased switching losses, higher electromagnetic interference (EMI), and potentially larger heat sink requirements. The choice of switching frequency should consider trade-offs based on the application's specific requirements, balancing factors such as efficiency, size constraints, EMI concerns, and thermal management.

    \subsection{SMPS vs Conventional Voltage Regulators}
        SMPS is more efficient than conventional voltage regulators for several reasons. 
        Firstly, a conventional voltage regulator regulates the output voltage by controlling the current flow between the input and output terminals. This is achieved using a pass transistor (typically a bipolar junction transistor or a MOSFET) connected in series between the input and output terminals. The pass transistor acts as a variable resistance, fundamentally adjusting its impedance to drop the excess voltage across it and maintain a stable output voltage. The downside is that the series transistor is continually biased in its linear region, dissipating power in the form of heat. Since all the load current must pass through the series transistor, this results in poor efficiency, wasted \(iV\) or \(i^2R\) power and continuous heat generation around the transistor. In contrast, SMPS operate by rapidly switching the input voltage on and off. When the switching transistor is on and conducting current, the voltage drop across it is at its minimal value, and when the transistor is off, there is no current flow through it. So the transistor is acting like an ideal on/off switch. This means that the majority of the \(iV\) power losses occur during the switching phase, which is very short in comparison to the constant power loss in conventional voltage regulators.
        Secondly, something worth mentioning is the space efficiency of SMPS compared to conventional voltage regulators. Due to the large power dissipation of conventional voltage regulators, the heat sinks on them are usually much larger. As well as this, SMPS is able to use much smaller components due to the higher switching frequency and is, therefore, more energy dense and more efficient in terms of its overall size-to-power loss ratio.

    \subsection{MOSFET vs IGBT}
        Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) and Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET) are both semiconductor devices, but they have key differences, as shown in Table \ref{tab: SMPS Comparison}.
